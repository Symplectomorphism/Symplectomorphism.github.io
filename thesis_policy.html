<h1>Thesis Policy</h1>

<h2>What we currently have</h2>

<p>As far as I have observed, everything we have about thesis and committee preparation 
is provided under the <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/coen-mbe/files/2020/05/Graduate-Student-Handbook.pdf">Graduate Student Handbook (GSH)</a>. It is probably a better idea to provide 
this information in a related pane under the graduate website itself. </p>

<p>In the GSH, we provide the following information.</p>

<ul>
<li>Thesis-based MS degree requires performing independent and novel research.</li>
<li>A minimum of 6 credit of thesis work are required (there is a grammatical error here 
in the GSH) for a MS degree, but it is common for students to have an excess of thesis 
credits.</li>
<li>Students must be enrolled in at least 1 credit of thesis (what?) in the semester in 
which they defend their thesis.</li>
<li>We have a flow chart for MS timeline, where we lay out when to outline and propose 
the thesis, present proposal, carry out research, and defend thesis.</li>
<li>There is a supposed link <em>forming a thesis committee</em>, however, the link does not 
work.</li>
<li>There is an explanation of candidacy and how it works.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feedback from students</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Formalize thesis proposal process (Wankun):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Currently the proposal process is not formalized. </li>
<li>The ECE department has the proposal listed as a 1-credit pass/fail course in which 
students enroll during the semester they plan to present the proposal.</li>
<li>We can require the student to complete the core courses before being able to 
enroll in this proposal course.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Time between proposal and defense (Wankun and Nardos):</strong> There should be at least 
one semester between the proposal and defense. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semester calendar with deadlines (Nardos and Dan's student):</strong> e.g. deadlines to 
apply for defense or proposal, admission deadlines, deadline to form committee. Define 
the timeline/roadmap clearly.</p></li>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Suggestions for improvement</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>We should formalize the proposal process.</p>

<ul>
<li>We are currently doing oral proposals. Do we want written proposals? 
<ul>
<li>Detailed inputs of the proposed idea.</li>
<li>Contents: abstract, introduction with main objective, background, and methods.</li>
<li>Should be concise and to-the-point.</li>
<li>Nardos likes the idea of a written proposal; whereas, Wankun prefers oral.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Oral proposal should include: (1) review of literature, (2) research objectives 
and scope, (3) methods, and (4) timeline of the anticipated research.</li>
<li>A timeline for the oral proposal is given in the GSH: in the summer semester 
before the second year.</li>
<li>Defense and proposal should not occur on the same semester. Students should 
propose at least 1 semester prior to the defense.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Do we want to require MS students to have a peer-reviewed paper submitted or ready to 
be submitted by the time of the defense?</p>

<ul>
<li>Could not find information about this from other schools.</li>
<li>For most Ph.D. programs, I believe there is an implicit expectation for at least 
1 (preferable 2 or more) journal publication.</li>
<li>Feedback from Nardos: "Yes, working towards a deadline other than the 
thesis helps students collect content for their defense. It also makes them compare the 
quality of their work to the rest of the academic world."</li>
<li>Feedback from Wankun: "In my opinion, MS students should have at least one peer-
reviewed paper ready for submission by the time of their defense."</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>What are the requirements for the written and oral defense? What elements need to be 
included?</p>

<ul>
<li>Do we want a standard layout for the written defense (e.g., introduction, 
background, methods, results, and conclusions)?</li>
<li>Wankun seems to like the current requirements.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Move the core information in the GSH to the graduate student website.</p></li>
<li>Add LaTeX and Word templates for thesis writing.</li>
<li>Add a section for campus resources on writing workshops.</li>
<li>Deadline information may be made more visible.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suggestions for webpage improvements on thesis prep and policy</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>One detailed page on the steps taken from admission to graduation:</strong> explain the steps needed from graduate college to departmental admission. Proceed into explaining core classes and when they should be taken, expectations during graduate work, when to form a committee, when to apply for proposal, candidacy and defense,and when to last apply for graduation. It is important that this is all in one place and in the proper order so students know what to look for.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How to form a committee</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Templates:</strong> thesis/defense, comprehensive exams and proposals, posters, commonly 
used conference or archive paper templates. Also links to good resources on LaTeX.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Forms:</strong> for any applications needed such as scheduling exams, proposals, defense,
and applying to graduate school.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scholarships/waivers/assistantships</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conference funding:</strong> where to find them, how to apply</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tips on literature survey:</strong> such as where to find papers and how to use BSU's 
portal to reach them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Newsletter:</strong> on seminars, conferences and talks</p></li>

<h2>Discussions in the Graduate Meeting</h2>

<h3>Proposal process</h3>

<p>We should have redundancy and flexibility.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Erin: likes the written proposal. </p>

<ul>
<li>The earlier is the better</li>
<li>Oral is fine as well.</li>
<li>She prefers to have both.</li>
<li>RO3 type of (6-page) proposal.</li>
<li>The general methodology of the research should be provided in the written proposal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Trevor: </p>

<ul>
<li>Oral is the chance to get good feedback.</li>
<li>Thinks is the most important part is the feedback. </li>
<li>In the proposal, there should be a timeline. </li>
<li>The methods section should be left flexible to individual student.</li>
<li>We should provide a template to the students so that they are not overwhelmed with time 
requirements, etc.</li>
<li>Identify what every faculty member wants to have in the written proposals of their students and 
let the advisor guide the rest.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Gunes: </p>

<ul>
<li>Oral proposal is good.</li>
<li>Written: MS students have 1-2 semester to work on the project fully.</li>
<li>The written proposal may be overwhelming for the student (busywork?)</li>
<li>The written proposal should be something that they can copy \&amp; paste into their final thesis.</li>
<li>Trevor and Erin agreed with Gunes about the written proposal's structure.</li>
<li>Format of the written proposal: Template should be cleverly designed to facilitate paper 
production.</li>
<li>Write the proper introduction and not the background section necessarily.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mahmood:</p>

<ul>
<li>The content of the written proposal should be left to the advisor?</li>
<li>We should have the oral proposal.</li>
<li>We should be wary of overwhelming the students with a written proposal.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dan:</p>

<ul>
<li>We may be asking too much of the student: oral, written proposal and a paper?</li>
<li>Oral or written proposal is fine. </li>
<li>Just a short abstract on top of an oral proposal may be enough to count for a written proposal.</li>
<li>Perhaps we could provide a group of questions for the students to answer to count for a written 
proposal.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Future action Item: What does the template actually looks like for the oral and written proposal?</strong></p>

<h3>Peer-reviewed paper requirement</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Gunes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Paper requirement should be exist and be rigid.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Dan:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should the student be the first author or not?</li>
<li>Should we count patterns for a design project?</li>
<li>For students doing development work paper requirement may be too rigid.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Mahmood:</p>

<ul>
<li>Thinks we should encourage this but not necessarily make it rigid.</li>
<li>Advisor should be the key.</li>
<li>Setting the expectation at the beginning of hire for the student is important.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Trevor:</p>

<ul>
<li>We can make room for exceptions; however, these exceptions must be reviewed by the advisor or 
the committee. </li>
<li>If we do not get a publication out of a 2-year-invested student, we cannot be successful as 
faculty members.</li>
<li>First authorship is important.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Erin: </p>

<ul>
<li>Call this an academic product.</li>
<li>Include this in the oral or written proposal.</li>
<li>Leave the requirement to the discretion of the advisor.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Requirements for written and oral defense</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Trevor:</p>

<ul>
<li>Academic product is the <strong>heart</strong> of the thesis.</li>
<li>What are the highlights of research you've done?</li>
<li>Include a final chapter for future research / what was important about what you've 
done?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Erin: </p>

<ul>
<li>Intro, background</li>
<li>A copy \&amp; paste submitted articles/papers (might have to be edited later) </li>
<li>Future directions, conclusions, etc.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
