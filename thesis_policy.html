<h1>Thesis Policy</h1>

<h2>What we currently have</h2>

<p>As far as I have observed, everything we have about thesis and committee preparation 
is provided under the <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/coen-mbe/files/2020/05/Graduate-Student-Handbook.pdf">Graduate Student Handbook (GSH)</a>. It is probably a better idea to provide 
this information in a related pane under the graduate website itself. </p>

<p>In the GSH, we provide the following information.</p>

<ul>
<li>Thesis-based MS degree requires performing independent and novel research.</li>
<li>A minimum of 6 credit of thesis work are required (there is a grammatical error here 
in the GSH) for a MS degree, but it is common for students to have an excess of thesis 
credits.</li>
<li>Students must be enrolled in at least 1 credit of thesis (what?) in the semester in 
which they defend their thesis.</li>
<li>We have a flow chart for MS timeline, where we lay out when to outline and propose 
the thesis, present proposal, carry out research, and defend thesis.</li>
<li>There is a supposed link <em>forming a thesis committee</em>, however, the link does not 
work.</li>
<li>There is an explanation of candidacy and how it works.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feedback from students</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>One detailed page on the steps taken from admission to graduation:</strong> explain the steps needed from graduate college to departmental admission. Proceed into explaining core classes and when they should be taken, expectations during graduate work, when to form a committee, when to apply for proposal, candidacy and defense,and when to last apply for graduation. It is important that this is all in one place and in the proper order so students know what to look for.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How to form a committee</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Templates:</strong> thesis/defense, comprehensive exams and proposals, posters, commonly 
used conference or archive paper templates. Also links to good resources on LaTeX.</p></li>
