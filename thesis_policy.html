<h1>Thesis Policy</h1>

<h2>What we currently have</h2>

<p>As far as I have observed, everything we have about thesis and committee preparation 
is provided under the <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/coen-mbe/files/2020/05/Graduate-Student-Handbook.pdf">Graduate Student Handbook (GSH)</a>. It is probably a better idea to provide 
this information in a related pane under the graduate website itself. </p>

<p>In the GSH, we provide the following information.</p>

<ul>
<li>Thesis-based MS degree requires performing independent and novel research.</li>
<li>A minimum of 6 credit of thesis work are required (there is a grammatical error here 
in the GSH) for a MS degree, but it is common for students to have an excess of thesis 
credits.</li>
<li>Students must be enrolled in at least 1 credit of thesis (what?) in the semester in 
which they defend their thesis.</li>
<li>We have a flow chart for MS timeline, where we lay out when to outline and propose 
the thesis, present proposal, carry out research, and defend thesis.</li>
<li>There is a supposed link <em>forming a thesis committee</em>, however, the link does not 
work.</li>
<li>There is an explanation of candidacy and how it works.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Feedback from students</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Formalize thesis proposal process (Wankun):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Currently the proposal process is not formalized. </li>
<li>The ECE department has the proposal listed as a 1-credit pass/fail course in which 
students enroll during the semester they plan to present the proposal.</li>
<li>We can require the student to complete the core courses before being able to 
enroll in this proposal course.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Time between proposal and defense (Wankun and Nardos):</strong> There should be at least 
one semester between the proposal and defense. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Semester calendar with deadlines (Nardos and Dan's student):</strong> e.g. deadlines to 
apply for defense or proposal, admission deadlines, deadline to form committee. Define 
the timeline/roadmap clearly.</p></li>
</ul>

</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Suggestions for improvement</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>We should formalize the proposal process.</p>

<ul>
<li>We are currently doing oral proposals. Do we want written proposals? 
<ul>
<li>Detailed inputs of the proposed idea.</li>
<li>Contents: abstract, introduction with main objective, background, and methods.</li>
<li>Should be concise and to-the-point.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A timeline for the oral proposal is given in the GSH: in the summer semester 
before the second year.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Do we want to require MS students to have a peer-reviewed paper submitted or ready to 
be submitted by the time of the defense?</p>

<ul>
<li>Could not find information about this from other schools.</li>
<li>For most Ph.D. programs, I believe there is an implicit expectation for at least 
1 (preferable 2 or more) journal publication.</li>
<li>Feedback from Nardos: "Yes, working towards a deadline other than the 
thesis helps students collect content for their defense. It also makes them compare the 
quality of their work to the rest of the academic world."</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Move the core information in the GSH to the graduate student website.</p></li>
<li>Add LaTeX and Word templates for thesis writing.</li>
<li>Add a section for campus resources on writing workshops.</li>
<li>Deadline information may be made more visible.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Suggestions for webpage improvements on thesis prep and policy</h3>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>One detailed page on the steps taken from admission to graduation:</strong> explain the steps needed from graduate college to departmental admission. Proceed into explaining core classes and when they should be taken, expectations during graduate work, when to form a committee, when to apply for proposal, candidacy and defense,and when to last apply for graduation. It is important that this is all in one place and in the proper order so students know what to look for.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>How to form a committee</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Templates:</strong> thesis/defense, comprehensive exams and proposals, posters, commonly 
used conference or archive paper templates. Also links to good resources on LaTeX.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Forms:</strong> for any applications needed such as scheduling exams, proposals, defense,
and applying to graduate school.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scholarships/waivers/assistantships</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Conference funding:</strong> where to find them, how to apply</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tips on literature survey:</strong> such as where to find papers and how to use BSU's 
portal to reach them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Newsletter:</strong> on seminars, conferences and talks</p></li>
