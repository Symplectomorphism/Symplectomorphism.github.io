### Robotics, Control, and Machine Learning
Our lab engages in foundational research in robotics, nonlinear control, and 
machine learning with tools from Bayesian statistics, optimization, and 
algebraic/differential geometry. We tackle outstanding problems in robotics where general computational algorithms cannot find elegant solutions necessitating the exploitation of the natural dynamics to yield dramatically improved performance.
