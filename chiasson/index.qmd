John was an incredible human being whom I first met in 2016, during my faculty candidate interview at Boise State University.
Tragically, we lost him on February 26, 2025. I still miss him so ... so much that every now and then I will share some 
of my memories of him in the this [blog](/chiasson/blog.qmd).
