Captain Zach Adams is an F-15 pilot. He is also the CEO of the company Pitch Aeronautics.
Pitch Aero develops a special drone that can install and uninstall dynamic line rating sensors on power lines.
Zach wanted to take some off Air Force to concentrate on the company for a while. He invited John and I in particular 
for his last flight before the sabbatical. He flew the F-15 quite amazingly. We also got to see some F-35s close up as well.
What's more, Captain Zach showed the interior of his F-15 to John and I. 

John and I enjoyed that day a lot. We got to meet Captain Zach's dad, who is also a pilot, it turns out!
Of course, a lot of gossip was made that day as well on somebody else who was there; but I'll keep that to myself.
